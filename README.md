Possible knight movements on a chess board. A knight can move anywhere on a chess board with maximum 5 moves. Logic comes from an api to read possible movements. Tiles identified as list items and they obtain or lose class based on their situation.

Squares are always clickable, change in start or end positions can be done via clicking them again. Steps are numerated to clarify the path. White and black board is a classic so I decided to colorize the knight only.
